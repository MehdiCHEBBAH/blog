This system was based on a graph where papers, authors, and </span><strong><span>topics</span></strong><span> are nodes, and relations between them are edges. And it functions as follows:</span></p><ul><li><span>If a paper is related to a topic we create a connection between the two.</span></li><li><span>If an author is interested in a topic we create a connection between the two.</span></li><li><span>We recommend to authors papers that are related to the topics that they are interested in.</span></li></ul><p><span>To implement this system we have to use a topic modeling model that extracts the topics from papers. Then use these topics to build the graph. We decided to go with </span><strong><span>Top2Vec</span></strong><span> to accomplish this task, and here is how we used it:</span></p><p><img src="assets/Models-topic_modeling.png"  /></p><ol start='' ><li><span>First, the model takes the inputs (which are the abstracts of papers) and Embeds them using the Embedding model (The </span><strong><span>USE</span></strong><span> model in our case but any embedding model will fit here).</span></li><li><span>The second step is to reduce the dimensionality of the Embeddings space using the </span><strong><span>UMAP</span></strong><span> algorithm to create dense areas. These dense areas contain geometrically close words (Semantically close Words).</span></li><li><span>Cluster the results using a density-based clustering algorithm (The </span><strong><span>HDBSCAN</span></strong><span> is used here). Then calculate the centroids of each cluster (These centroids are considered as the representative vector of the topic).</span></li><li><span>Get the K closest words to the center of each cluster using the </span><strong><span>K-NN</span></strong><span> algorithm (These words represent the keywords of each topic). The outputs of this model are the list of topics and keywords (that will be used to create the graph nodes and edges related to topics) and the trained model (that will be used later to cluster new papers into the right topic).</span></li></ol><p><span>This was just one simple real-world use-case of topic modeling techniques that I have personally faced. There are tons of other use-cases that every NLP engineer would face at least once in his career. </span></p><h4 id='thank-you-for-your-reading'><span>Thank you for your reading</span></h4><p><span>If you are interested in topic modeling algorithms in-depth you could read these papers:</span></p><ul><li><span>Top2Vec: </span><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09470' target='_blank' class='url'>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09470</a></li><li><span>LDA: </span><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation' target='_blank' class='url'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation</a></li><li><span>LSA: </span><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis' target='_blank' class='url'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis</a></li><li><span>BERTopic: </span><a href='https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html' target='_blank' class='url'>https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html</a></li><li><span>Top2Vec: </span><a href='https://github.com/ddangelov/Top2Vec' target='_blank' class='url'>https://github.com/ddangelov/Top2Vec</a></li><li><span>HDP: </span><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Dirichlet_process' target='_blank' class='url'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Dirichlet_process</a></li></ul></div></div>
